[2019-02-04 15:11:42.762] [jointLog] [info] Computed 9369 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-02-04 15:11:42.762] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4034409 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-02-04 15:11:42.773] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0182292% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2019-02-04 15:11:42.774] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4034409 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
