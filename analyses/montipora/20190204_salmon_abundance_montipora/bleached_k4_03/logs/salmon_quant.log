[2019-02-04 15:01:51.666] [jointLog] [info] Computed 10019 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-02-04 15:01:51.666] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3376115 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-02-04 15:01:51.678] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0154075% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2019-02-04 15:01:51.679] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3376115 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
