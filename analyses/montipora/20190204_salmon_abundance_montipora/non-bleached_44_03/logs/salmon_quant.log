[2019-02-04 15:14:04.584] [jointLog] [info] Computed 9659 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-02-04 15:14:04.584] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4631614 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-02-04 15:14:04.596] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00647718% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2019-02-04 15:14:04.597] [jointLog] [warning] Only 4631614 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
