[2019-02-04 15:07:56.736] [jointLog] [info] Counted 5189299 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-02-04 15:07:56.749] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0187831% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
