[2019-02-04 14:58:53.065] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0186096% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2019-02-04 14:58:53.066] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2606773 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
